            <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruchitrambalam">Thiruchitrambalam</a></h3>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruchitrambalam"><img src=" https://sund-images.sunnxt.com/78501/960x540_Thiruchitrambalam_78501_e2ed6926-f955-4763-888a-a44c62377bc9.jpg" alt="Poster of Thiruchitrambalam" height="250" /></a>

                Never did I think this would be one of my favourite movies when I first saw the trailer. It's such a feel good movie and what made the watch-experience more special is that, I went to watch it with my dosths.

                The series still has few more seasons that I'm yet to watch. Currently on hold. But I would definietly vouch for the series considering
                <ol>
                    <li>the spectacular screenplay</li>
                    <li>perfectly handled plot twists</li>
                    <li>plot that's driven in a way that triggers curiosity in the viewers leading them to binge watch and ask more</li>
                </ol> Moreover, this series kinda ignited a spark in me to LEARN - How important Education is. And look where it got me finally - I learning man. Hahaha.
            </p>

            <p>
                Yet another movie - could even be the last movie that I watched with my Homies. Pff. Though the movie is not really something that I would love to watch again, it holds a special place in our hearts because of the foresaid reason.
